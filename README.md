# OculusVRCasting
We're developed this software for Oculus Quest 1/2/3/3S to make casting(streaming) is more accessible. If your SideQuest/QLoader or another software is not working - here's solution!

Representing VR-PC Streaming v.1.0

Latest Release: https://github.com/merchantingsolutions/OculusVRStreaming/releases

You should download latest release and then extract anywhere you want (be sure that folder does not have any symbols, only ENGLISH name of folder with software to avoid errors on start). For example: C:/PCVRSTREAMING/

*Developer Mode on your device should be enabled. 
If you don't know how to enable "Developer's Mode" - check this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxzkVtrUWzc

If you have only cable without wiriless mode - you can connect your headset to PC via cable and then click "Cast" and all should work.

*After connecting you might get a message on the device to accept the connection to PC, click the checkbox "Remember this PC" and you will not get this message anymore, this will make simple and easy to connect it later.

I got this idea from this video, thanks for your support <3:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WbRIWfaClE.

Thanks @Cleavix for some source code that needs to do that app.
